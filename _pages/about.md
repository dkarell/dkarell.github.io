I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Yale University and a Faculty Fellow at Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies. I teach courses on integrating AI into social science research methods, computational approaches to studying culture, and the sociology of backlash. I also co-organize Yale's [Computational Social Science Workshop](https://isps.yale.edu/computational-social-science-workshop). 

Some of my current research examines how people's interactions with AI can influence their understanding of the social world, including their perceptions of history and behavior towards people in different social groups. I am also conducting a long-term project on the social and cultural dynamics of backlash, with a focus on the Blue Lives Matter movement. For more information about my research, see [here](https://dkarell.github.io/research/).

### AI for Social Science Research Methods

I am currently developing and teaching a course on incorporating generative AI into social science research methods.
