I am an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Yale University. I teach courses on integrating AI into social science research methods, computational approaches to studying culture, and the sociology of backlash. I also co-organize Yale's [Computational Social Science Workshop](https://isps.yale.edu/computational-social-science-workshop) and am a Faculty Fellow at Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies.

My current research uses computational, quantiative, and experimental methods to examine the intersection of social movements, culture, and technology. For example, some of my current projects investigate how people's interactions with AI can influence their understanding of the social world, including their perceptions of history and behavior towards people in different social groups. Another project analyzes the social and cultural dynamics of backlash, with a focus on the Blue Lives Matter movement.

### Teaching How to Use AI for Social Science Research

I am currently teaching a course on incorporating generative AI into social science research methods.
