I am developing and teaching a course on incorporating generative AI into social science research methods. The course builds on a special issue of *Sociological Methods and Research* that I co-guest-edited with Thomas Davidson (Rutgers University). The special issue can be found [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/smra/54/3).
