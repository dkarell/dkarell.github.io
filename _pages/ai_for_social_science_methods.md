During Fall 2025, I am teaching a new course on incorporating generative AI into social science research methods. I will post my materials here, along with notes about what did and did not work. If you are considering teaching this type of course, or already teaching it, I would love to hear from you. My hope is to help build a community of social scientists teaching about AI as a research tool. 

## Course materials

I have compiled an initial reading list and created progamming-based activities for students. These are all works-in-progress. If you want to share ideas and/or comments about these materials, please feel free to send me an email. 

Much of the course's content builds on a special issue of *Sociological Methods & Research* that I co-guest-edited with Thomas Davidson (Rutgers University). The special issue can be found [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/smra/54/3). Hridhay Suresh (Yale University) assisted with the initial development of the activities.

### Activities

The files for the programming-based activities are available through the following links. These are the first versions, and I will update them as I teach the course.

- An activity about prompting: [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cjusnjy4971rcr7gio379/activity_1_prompting_v1.pdf?rlkey=azilx8kchd4fsqjtw12buaav0&st=n8owjx27&dl=0) and [R Markdown](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ann9zxnwcepv7ib15nz59/activity_1_prompting_v1.Rmd?rlkey=18hxmmciyfh5qg076scme2i3m&st=4pnow5ht&dl=0)
- An activity about using LLMs to generate human-like data: [PDF](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qmsu9sqk775gita7bcli6/activity_2_siliconsubjects_v1.pdf?rlkey=towslzwnj8pghu0lioejnlvrv&st=7b0cfk96&dl=0) and [R Markdown](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/lym1qpxj0qso5h6zo8z3n/activity_2_siliconsubjects_v1.Rmd?rlkey=psuwibn3s8kao7b5x50pm3w1j&st=vspaut3y&dl=0)
- An activitiy about measurement and bias: [in progress]

### Reading list

My initial reading list is below. It is intended for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in social science majors and programs. As I teach the course, I will add notes about how students respond to each reading. 

Using AI in the social sciences is a rapidly-growing area of research. There are many excellent papers not included in my current reading list. This is mainly because I am trying out combinations of papers that, first, cover a range of topics and emerging debates (in one semester) and, second, are accessible and interesting to students. If you have suggestions of readings to add, please feel free to email me and I will update the list.
