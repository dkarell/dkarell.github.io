I am developing and teaching a course on incorporating generative AI into social science research methods. The course builds on a special issue of *Sociological Methods and Research* that I co-guest-edited with Thomas Davidson (Rutgers University). The special issue can be found [here](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/smra/54/3).

I have compiled an initial reading list and, with Hridhay Suresh (Yale University), created progamming-based activities for students. These are all works-in-progress. If you are interested in sharing ideas and/or comments about these materials, please feel free to send me an email. I think it would be great to form a community of social scientists teaching about AI as tool to enchance research methods. 

### Activities

The files for the programming-based activities (or "labs" or "problems sets") can be accessed through the following links. There are both PDF and R Markdown versions.

- An activity about

- An activitiy about

### Reading list

My initial reading list is below. As I teach the course, I will add notes about how students responded to each reading. If you have suggestions of readings to add, please feel free to email me and I will update the list.
